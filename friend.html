					About My Friend
				</h2></legend>
					Friendship is one of the greatest blessings that not everyone is lucky enough to have.<br> 
				We meet a lot of people in the journey of life but there are only a few who leave a mark on us.<br> 
				My best friend is one such person who has been able to make a positive impact on my life.<br> 
				We have been a part of each otherâ€™s lives for the longest time and our friendship is still developing.<br> 
				Most importantly, I feel extremely fortunate to have someone as a best friend in my life. <br>
				In this essay on my best friend, I will tell you about how we became friends and about her best qualities.
